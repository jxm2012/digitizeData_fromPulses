# digitizeData_fromPulses

Program done as an assignmnet for a Signal Processing class taught by Dr. Brezeale in CSE-3313 at UT Arlington

Given values in a file named data-communications.csv, containing a sequence of pulses in the range between 0 to 1, 
this processes digitized data using a matched filter. This is done to see whether the pulses (sequences) 
are either a 0 bit or 1 bit in order to read a message in the csv file. The filter is used to find the angle ัฒ
between real vectors 'v' and 'w' for the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.
